# üöç Smart Transit Simulation ‚Äì Route 601 (York Region)

Welcome to our MMA Practicum Project repository, where we explore how data science and simulation can improve public transit reliability in York Region.

This project focuses on **Route 601**, a major arterial transit line running along Yonge Street, connecting key regional terminals and communities. Using real operational data and machine learning, we built a comprehensive simulation system to analyze delays, model passenger flow, and evaluate scheduling strategies.

## üë• Our Team

This project is proudly built by a 3-member team from the Master of Management Analytics program at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management:

## üí° Project Highlights

- Delay classification using XGBoost  
- Passenger arrival rate estimation using Poisson processes  
- Probabilistic modeling of alighting behavior  
- High-resolution simulation engine for full-route performance evaluation  
- Actionable insights into timing, bottlenecks, and scheduling strategies

## üì¶ Coming Soon

We are currently preparing the codebase, simulation components, and all necessary documentation for open release.  
‚û°Ô∏è The project will be **fully packaged and published** soon for easy reproduction and further development.

Stay tuned!
